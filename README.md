# Data Analytics & Data Science Portfolio

A clean, single-file portfolio site you can deploy with **GitHub Pages**.

## Quick start

1. Create a new repository on GitHub (public), named anything you like (e.g., `data-portfolio`).
2. Upload *all files in this folder* to the repository root (including `index.html`).
3. Go to **Settings → Pages**:
   - **Source**: *Deploy from a branch*
   - **Branch**: `main` (or `master`) / **root**
4. Wait for the site to build. Your site will be live at:  
   `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

### Customize
- Replace `[Your Name]` in `index.html` with your name.
- Update your project links (GitHub, Tableau/Power BI, notebooks).
- Put your resume file in the repo as `resume.pdf` (or update the link).
- Replace `assets/profile-placeholder.jpg` with your photo (same filename).

### Optional: Use a custom domain
- Add your domain in **Settings → Pages** and create a `CNAME` DNS record pointing to `your-username.github.io`.

Happy building!
